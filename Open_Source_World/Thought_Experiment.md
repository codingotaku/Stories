# The World of Open Source

## This is a thought experiment

>! What if a certain intelligent alien race shared a common brain?

In a place far away from our observable universe, there exists a planet named X. Much like Earth, this planet is inhibited by a large variety of species!  
Some of them can fly through storms, and some of them can swim in dangerously hot lava, because life always finds a way.

Along with these bizarre creatures there was a certain species who evolved enough to create **civilizations**!
They migrate and explore their little muddy planet and colonize.  
They make up their on laws and culture within that colony. They are like **bees**, each colony has a Queen whome they worship and protect.  
Her words are absolute! She bends all the laws and even moral codes according to her desire. the people will work like slaves and submit to her will without a second thought! Not because of their lack of will power, instead they have a common goal, to please the Queen!
